            <h2 class="heading-secondary">WHAT IS A SEASONAL CLEANSE?</h2>
            <p>A Seasonal Cleanse is a defined time to create clarity and promote healthy functioning in the body and mind. It’s an excellent opportunity to make BIG shifts in a short window of time.<br><br>
                According to the 5000-year-old wisdom of Ayurveda, spring and autumn are the ideal times to detoxify the body. These seasons are junctures where the earth moves from cold to hot (spring) and from hot to cold (autumn). Cleansing at these times supports strong immune and digestive function.<br><br>
                Cleansing helps you hit the “reset button” on your habits. It isn’t all about food or losing weight. It’s about connecting more deeply to your body’s innate ability to heal, renew and replenish.</p>

        <h2 class="tow-seasons__heading">Seasonal Cleansing is a twice-yearly reset for your entire being. Just for a short time you get totake really good care of YOU! Suitable for absolute beginners and well-seasoned detoxers. </h2>

            <h2 class="heading-secondary">Autumn Cleanse</h2>
            <p>When we cleanse and reset in the autumn, we
              clear out the heat and inflammation
              accumulated over the summer and bolster the
              immune system. We ground down and nourish
              to prepare for the winter.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-secondary">Spring Cleanse</h2>
            <p>When we cleanse and reset in the spring, we clear out congestion and stagnation (excess mucous and fat) accumulated over the winter.We energise and lighten things up to prepare for the summer</p>

        </div>
        <p class="tow-seasons__text">The Seasonal Cleanse is NOT a fast, but rather a nourishing 15-day program of eating simple, clean foods that have seasonal cleansing and clarifying qualities, and practicing daily self-care techniques to loosen impurities and stimulate your lymphatic system, the mainline for Seasonal Cleansing.</p>

          <h2 class="heading-secondary">HOW DOES THE SEASONAL CLEANSE WORK?</h2>
          <p class="works__paragraph">Digestion gets gunked up over time. If we don’t take time to expel this build up, season to season, it creates toxins in the body. Toxins lead to imbalance which lead to degeneration and dis-ease.
                                      Getting rid of stuff is something the body is good at (so long as you provide a bit of space, a simple diet and rest). Clearing the body’s channels biannually ensures it has an opportunity to recalibrate and head into the next half of the year in top form.
